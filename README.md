# Múcaro | BGP Routing Exposure Lookup

**It maps an organization’s observed internet connections to help analysts
investigate external dependencies and changes.**

This tool helps us understand which networks sit between an organization and the
wider internet. It uses publicly available routing information to show connections
that have been observed and how they change over time.

This is a proof-of-concept analyst tool. Its design and outputs are informed by publicly available BGP observations, routing research, and data from RIPE and CAIDA. It supports investigation and learning; it does not prove traffic flow, reachability, intent, or a vulnerability.

Think of it as studying a road map around a building: it helps identify possible
approaches, but it doesn’t tell us which road a particular visitor took—or whether
any doors are unlocked.

Investigate **which external networks are observed immediately before a target
origin AS, for which prefixes, and how those observations change over time**.
Use public BGP observations, separately inferred relationships, and saved evidence
to investigate routing dependencies. Provider identification is supporting context.

**Status:** local analyst/research prototype. It does not measure your traffic's
actual path, identify exploitable entry points, or prove an organization's complete
external connectivity. The bundled server is not a production public service.

## Quick start

You need **Python 3.10+**, a modern browser, working HTTPS certificate trust,
Internet access for live lookups, and a writable cache directory. Origin Mapping
can use several hundred MB of memory. The local workflow has been verified on
macOS; Windows and Linux have not been validated for this release.

The application uses Python's standard library. No Python packages, Node.js,
API key, or separate database installation are required. Python's bundled SQLite
stores the request counter and timing automatically. No GitHub login is required
to clone this public repository or run an extracted copy.

### 1. Get the code and start the server

In Terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bayanilla/bgp-routing-exposure-lookup.git
cd bgp-routing-exposure-lookup
python3 --version
python3 server.py
```

If you already downloaded and extracted the project, open Terminal in its folder
and run the last two commands. These examples use a macOS/Linux-style shell.

### 2. Open the interface and run a lookup

1. Open [http://127.0.0.1:8765](http://127.0.0.1:8765).
2. Leave **Observed BGP paths** selected and enter `AS3333`.
3. Select **Latest**, then **Find observed paths**.
4. Expand a path/prefix summary. AS names appear inline when available.

The top-right indicators independently show whether the local server can reach
RIPE paths, RIPE RPKI, CAIDA organization names, and CAIDA relationship data. They make
small source-access checks and do not submit a lookup target.
5. Review warnings and source dates before exporting **CSV** or **JSON**.

AS3333 is RIPE NCC’s network and is used as a public routing example. No
affiliation or endorsement by RIPE NCC is implied.

The first lookup can take longer while public datasets download. Keep the terminal
running; stop the server with `Ctrl+C` when finished. Opening `web/index.html`
directly does not run the app. If port 8765 is occupied, start with
`python3 server.py --port 8766` and open [port 8766](http://127.0.0.1:8766).
See [troubleshooting](docs/operations.md#troubleshooting) for other problems.

## Choose a lookup mode

| | Observed BGP paths | Origin Mapping | Live RIS View |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Question | Which networks appear immediately before the origin AS? | Which AS announces the prefix covering an address or range? | What updates is RIS observing for one selected AS right now? |
| Inputs | ASN (`AS3333`), IP, or CIDR | IP, CIDR, or start-end range | One AS number |
| Routing source | RIPE RIS paths via RIPEstat | CAIDA RouteViews prefix-to-AS snapshots | RIPE RIS Live WebSocket |
| Supporting data | CAIDA names and inferred relationships | CAIDA names | Collector and peer information in each update |
| History | Observation at 12:00 UTC on the selected date | Latest available routing snapshot within the selected date | Temporary, current event stream only |
| Import limit | 1,000 entries | 1,000 entries | One active AS subscription |

Neither mode probes the destination. Historical availability and collector coverage
vary. For a displayed prefix–origin pair, **Check RPKI authorization** optionally
asks RIPE whether the pairing matches a published ROA. It is current authorization
context, not a verdict on a route, incident, or vulnerability. See [date semantics](docs/user-guide.md#current-and-historical-data).

## Live RIS View

Select **Live RIS View**, enter one AS number, and choose **Start live view**.
The default filter shows updates where that AS is the origin; the broader option
shows updates where it appears anywhere in an observed path. The view displays
the most recent 250 RIS Live announcements or withdrawals with the collector,
peer ASN, prefixes, and an AS path when one is present.

The browser opens a direct, temporary connection to RIPE RIS only after you
select **Start live view**. RIPE can see the selected AS filter and your public
source IP. No RIPE account or API key is required at present. Select **Stop** to
close the connection and clear displayed events. The view does not retain events,
create alerts, or establish traffic flow, reachability, a policy violation, or a
security incident.

## Worked investigation

**Question:** Which networks are observed adjacent to AS3333 for a selected prefix,
and does that observation differ between two dates?

### 1. Inspect the evidence

Run the quick-start lookup and expand a path. The following is an **illustrative
example**, based on a RIS observation at 2026-09-30 07:59:47 UTC.
It is not a promise of current routing; your results may differ:

```text
Prefix: 193.0.0.0/21
Path:   AS24482 → AS20562 → AS1103 → AS3333
```

| Layer | Supported interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| Observed fact | AS1103 immediately precedes origin AS3333 in this path for this prefix at the recorded observation time. |
| Relationship inference | A separate CAIDA snapshot may classify AS1103 as provider, peer, or customer; absent evidence remains unknown. |
| Security interpretation | This is a routing dependency worth investigating, not a confirmed ingress point or vulnerability. |

AS20562 and AS24482 appear farther along this path; that does not make them direct
neighbors of AS3333. Record the **RIS observation time**, **collector coverage**,
**CAIDA source dates**, and any **warnings or truncation**. Peer counts measure
visibility in the collected data, not traffic share or confidence.

Each expanded path begins with an interactive **Observed AS-path overview**. It
places a compact, filtered subset of returned RIS AS-path records into columns
from five-or-more hops through the ASN observed immediately before the selected
origin. Select a displayed ASN to dim unrelated displayed segments and read its
returned-record count and displayed hop position. The overview is a public
collector-observation aid: it is not a packet path, physical topology, provider
relationship, or traffic-flow diagram. A network in the five-or-more-hop column
is not an observed adjacent ASN, and omitted nodes can interrupt a displayed
segment for readability.

Each expanded path also offers **Registered organization country context**. It
maps the CAIDA country field for each AS hop and lists its role, ASN, and
organization name. For an origin's observed adjacent networks, the map groups
markers by registered country; select a marker to inspect the included ASes.
Double-click an empty area to zoom, and double-click again to return to the full
map. The map is a compact reference for organization registration context, not a
geographic traffic route, network presence, or collector location.

The **Theme** menu changes the local display only and remembers the choice in
that browser. It does not alter data, queries, exports, or investigation bundles.

The leftmost AS is part of a route advertisement observed by RIS; it does not by
itself identify a traffic source or direct relationship with the origin.

### 2. Save a reproducible investigation

1. Keep the target in the input field and select the desired routing date.
2. Expand **Save and compare investigations**.
3. Select **Capture investigation**. This starts a new capture; it does not attach
   evidence retroactively to the ordinary lookup you just ran.
4. Review the results and replay checks, then select **Export investigation ZIP**.
5. Use **Open investigation** to reopen that ZIP later without external queries.

A matching replay means the saved evidence reproduces the processing results.
It does **not** authenticate the source or independently verify CAIDA enrichment.
Checksums detect accidental changes; they do not prevent fabricated evidence.

### 3. Compare two dates

1. Keep the same target inputs. Under **Save and compare investigations**, choose
   **Earlier date** and **Later date**; both use 12:00 UTC.
2. Select **Compare dates** and review both snapshots' statuses and source dates.
3. Expand **All observations**, **Common reporting peers**, and
   **Relationship inferences**. Check whether the reporting peers changed too.
4. Export the comparison JSON and the investigation ZIP containing both snapshots.

If an adjacency appears only in the later snapshot, report it as **newly observed**,
not a proven new connection. If a snapshot failed, the comparison is unavailable;
that is not evidence of disappearance. Common-peer comparisons are a visibility
check, not a correction for every collector bias.

To decide whether a change is expected, compare it with independent, time-aligned
operator records or authorized network measurements. Two snapshots cannot tell
you the exact change time or what happened between them. The tool does not
provide persistent monitoring or alerting. See the [investigation guide](docs/user-guide.md#saved-investigations-and-comparisons)
for bundle contents, replay limitations, and detailed comparison labels.

## Imports, progress, and cancellation

Paste one resource per line, or select **Import file** for CSV, TSV, or TXT.
A CSV can use a single recognized resource column, for example:

```csv
resource
AS3333
193.0.0.1
193.0.0.0/24
```

ASNs require the `AS` prefix and work only in Observed BGP paths. Both modes
accept up to **1,000 entries** within **262,144 bytes** of input text. Other CSV
columns are ignored; normalized duplicate targets are collapsed for server path
lookups and captures. See [all import rules](docs/user-guide.md#import-formats).

- **Progress:** current target, processed, completed, failed, special-use skipped,
  and remaining inputs. Comparisons show each snapshot separately.
- **Warnings:** review failed or unprocessed inputs, unavailable enrichment,
  partial coverage, and truncated evidence. Processing finished does not mean
  every entry succeeded or that routing visibility is complete.
- **Path-evidence cap:** collector, peer, prefix, and path counts describe all
  accepted RIS routes, but the detailed browser list and ordinary CSV retain a
  bounded subset divided among observed adjacent ASes. An investigation ZIP
  preserves the raw RIS response for offline replay.
- **Cancel lookup:** stops future work; an in-flight operation may finish first.
  Completed ordinary results remain exportable. Interrupted captures/comparisons
  do not produce an incomplete ZIP. Closing a tab does not cancel the job.

## Privacy and operating limits

**Local interface does not mean private queries.** Path lookups, captures, comparisons, and an optional RPKI check send normalized targets or the displayed prefix–origin pair to RIPE,
which also sees your public source IP. Live RIS View sends its selected AS filter
directly from the browser to RIPE RIS. CAIDA receives dataset download requests.
Offline bundle replay makes no external queries. Exports are unencrypted and may
contain sensitive investigation context. Read [query privacy](docs/operations.md#query-privacy)
before submitting confidential targets.

| Behavior | What to expect |
| --- | --- |
| RIPE pacing | One active request, then a two-second pause, shared across server tabs and job types; cache reuse, deduplication, and bounded retries reduce load. |
| Daily count | Notification at 1,000 attempts; no daily cap. Retries count, cache hits do not. |
| Large batches | 1,000 uncached requests need about 33 minutes of pacing alone, plus retrieval/processing. Two-date comparisons can double requests. |
| Capture size | 16 MB encoded evidence per snapshot; 32 MB ZIP; 48 MB expanded members. A 1,000-entry batch may still need splitting. |
| Result retention | Up to one hour; older finished jobs can be evicted earlier at 40 jobs or the shared 128 MB result/ZIP budget. Restart clears results. Save exports promptly. |
| Local access | Keep the default loopback binding. Connection protections do not make this a production public server. |

The storage budget is not a total process-memory cap. The request counter persists
in SQLite; lookup results do not. See [request pacing](docs/operations.md#respectful-ripe-requests-and-cancellation),
[progress and connection protections](docs/operations.md#progress-result-retention-and-connection-protection),
and [full limits](docs/operations.md#limits-caching-and-performance).

## What the evidence cannot establish

Public collectors do not reveal every provider, private peer, or physical link.
Names and inferred relationships may be incomplete or stale. The tool does not
perform traceroute, route-leak/hijack verdicts, vulnerability
scanning, or automatic mitigation. It is not yet validated against independent
ground truth as a complete measurement of organizational routing dependencies.
See [known limitations](docs/user-guide.md#known-limitations).
